# Timex
A consultant's time tracker for projects, activities, etc.

This is a Delphi project I wrote from 1998 to 2000, used for time tracking. It provided a fast user interface to allow users to easily and efficiently record time against different projects.

It should still compile fine in modern versions of Delphi, though the database was in Paradox and may need to be recreated in something else now. From the 'emptydb' folder we can see there are four tables: consultants, clients, jobs, slips - the "slips" being timeslip entries that tie together a consultant's time against a job for a client.
